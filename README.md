* COSC445
    * Audris Mockus
    * This is an advanced topic course focused on developing multi-disciplinary skills of discovering, retrieving, analyzing, and presenting operational data. Students will use critical thinking and intense practice solving real-world problems to recognize and address key operational issues: the lack of context, missing observations, and incorrect values. At the end of the course students will be able to discover operational data, to retrieve and store it, to recover context, to estimate the impact of missing events, to identify unreliable or incorrect values, and to present the results.

* EF203
    * Rapinder S Sawhney
    * The objective is to develop engineering focused critical problem solving skills for undergraduate engineering and business majors. Students are introduced to engineering problems from a systems perspective, allowing students to analyze a range of systems from simple entities to larger more complex systems such as organizations. There are three phases of the critical problem solving skills as exemplified by the DRIVES model. The first phase focuses on defining the right problem. The second phase details a solution based on the concepts of flow, variation, and disruption. The third phase introduces the sustainability of the solution based on the concepts of reliability and the role of culture in design.

    * Richard Keith Stanfill
    * The first part of a two-course sequence where teams of students from both the Tickle College of Engineering and Haslam College of Business partner with industry sponsors to design and build authentic products and processes. Working closely with an industry liaison engineer and a faculty coach, students gain practical experience in teamwork and communication, problem-solving and engineering design, and develop leadership, management and people skills. Weekly workshop activities adapt lecture topics to individual projects. Students learn firsthand how to develop products and processes that meet customer requirements on time and within budget. The sequence is serving students in the Heath Integrated Business and Engineering Program (Heath IBEP) and others within the two colleges.
